          <h2>Cutting Edge Video Compression</h2>
          <p>
            With SVT-AV1-PSY, we believe that we've created an encoder that
            isn't just capable of competing with the best in the business for
            AV1, but with newer codecs like VVC as well. The maturity of the
            x264 encoder allowed it to be a credit to the H.264 codec and
            improve its perception across the board, and we wish to achieve the
            same for AV1. The mainline SVT-AV1 project has done incredible work
            in providing a fast and powerful encoder for AV1, and efforts have
            been directed toward improving metric scores - our work has focused
            on producing visually compelling results.

          <p>
            Our bleeding-edge psychovisual approach has resulted in
            groundbreaking visual quality that places us far ahead of other open
            source AV1 encoders. You can use the slider below to compare our
            performance to other popular encoders, such as x264, x265, aomenc,
            and VVenC.

          <h2>Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            Somewhere out there, while we are saying "it isn't rocket science!",
            there is a rocket scientist saying "it isn't multimedia compression
            engineering!". Developing video encoders is hard, &amp; requires a
            deep understanding of human perception. Our approach to video
            encoding is to leverage our scientific understanding of the human
            visual system to produce better quality video.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike audio codec development where subjective evaluations are
            king, video compression is a field ruled by synthetic benchmarks
            that often fail to capture what is important to our eyes. Metrics
            are models, and they can be useful, but they are always flawed.
            While we care about some metrics (like XPSNR, SSIMULACRA2, and
            Butteraugli), we care more about what you see. Therefore, most of
            our time goes into understanding how our eyes respond to different
            compression artifacts and how we can minimize the error our eyes
            perceive.
